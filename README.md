Bug with locked mode


Instructions:
Open two windows of the locked form.
Click both of their continue buttons at the EXACT same time. Too late and it'll work as normal.
This exploit is probably only possible on touch screen due to how quick you need to be.
You should be in locked mode now, but it will only show a blank window with a forms icon at the bottom left. Click it.
It should now show the enter locked mode screen on the form when you're already in locked mode. Click continue.
Click the overview button on your keyboard. You'll be able to see all the windows, and hence "exit" locked mode. You can still return to the form and complete it.
